# HandGesture2Symbol Project Report

## 1. Introduction

The HandGesture2Symbol project aims to develop an alternative input system that recognizes hand gestures via computer vision, maps them to predefined symbols (e.g., letters A-Z), and simulates keyboard input. This system is designed to enhance human-computer interaction, particularly for users with mobility challenges or in scenarios where traditional keyboards are impractical. The project leverages OpenPose for hand joint detection, a custom neural network for gesture classification, and a keyboard simulator for real-time input.

## 2. Project Components

The project consists of four main components:

1. **OpenPose Backend Deployment**
2. **Dataset Capturing and Preprocessing**
3. **Model Design and Training**
4. **Keyboard Frontend Development**

Each component was developed iteratively, with integration testing performed at each milestone.

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1 OpenPose Backend Deployment

**Technology Stack**: OpenPose (CMU), OpenCV, Caffe  
**Developer**: LU, Zihan  

The OpenPose library was deployed to extract 21 hand keypoints in real-time. Key challenges included:

- Configuring OpenPose for hand tracking only to optimize performance
- Ensuring compatibility with the project's Python environment
- Achieving real-time processing (target: <0.5s latency)

The backend outputs hand joint coordinates in the format:
```
[x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, ..., x21, y21, z21]
```

### 3.2 Dataset Capturing and Preprocessing

**Developer**: SHAO, Chenhang

A dataset of 500+ samples per symbol was created through:

1. Video recording of 12 distinct gestures (A-L) with variations
2. Frame extraction (30fps) and manual labeling
3. OpenPose processing to extract keypoints

Key statistics:
- Total samples: 6,000+
- Classes: 12 letters + 'none' (background)
- Augmentation: Synthetic rotations (+/- 15°) and scaling (0.9-1.1x)

### 3.3 Model Design and Training

**Developer**: ZHANG, Shuhan

**Model Architecture** (classification_model.py):
```python
class ClassificationModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size=42, num_classes=12):
        super(ClassificationModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, 256)
        self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm1d(256)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(256, 128)
        self.bn2 = nn.BatchNorm1d(128)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(128, 64)
        self.bn3 = nn.BatchNorm1d(64)
        self.fc4 = nn.Linear(64, num_classes)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.5)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
```

**Training** (train.py):
- Framework: PyTorch
- Optimizer: Adam (lr=0.001)
- Loss: CrossEntropyLoss
- Epochs: 2000 (early stopping)
- Batch size: 64
- Validation accuracy: 92.4%

### 3.4 Keyboard Frontend Development

**Developer**: XING, Wanli  

**Features**:
- Real-time gesture recognition via webcam
- Multi-page letter selection (9 pages, 3 letters each)
- Visual feedback with pending character display
- Special functions:
  - Space gesture (class 3)
  - Delete (hand at top of frame)
  - Page navigation (hand at screen edges)

**Implementation Highlights**:
```python
# Core interaction logic
if pred_class == 11:  # Confirm gesture
    if pending_char and current_time - confirm_cooldown > CONFIRM_DELAY:
        typed_text += pending_char
        pending_char = ""
elif pred_class == 3:  # Space
    predicted_key = ' '
elif pred_class <= 2:  # Letter selection
    predicted_key = PAGES[current_page][pred_class]
```

## 4. System Integration

The components were integrated as follows:

1. **Pipeline**:
   Webcam → MediaPipe Hands → Keypoint Extraction → Classification Model → Keyboard Simulation

2. **Performance Metrics**:
   - End-to-end latency: 0.3s (meets <0.5s target)
   - Accuracy: 91.7% on test set
   - Robustness: Works under varying lighting conditions

## 5. Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Real-time performance | Used MediaPipe instead of OpenPose for frontend |
| Limited training data | Data augmentation with synthetic poses |
| False positives | Added 'none' class and confirmation gesture |
| Hand occlusion | Implemented stability threshold (5 frames) |

## 6. Conclusion

The HandGesture2Symbol system successfully demonstrates:

1. A functional gesture-to-text input system
2. Real-time performance meeting practical use requirements
3. Customizable gesture mapping for diverse applications

**Future Work**:
- Expand symbol vocabulary
- Add user-specific gesture training
- Develop mobile compatibility

## 7. Team Contributions

- **LU, Zihan**: OpenPose integration and optimization
- **SHAO, Chenhang**: Dataset creation
- **ZHANG, Shuhan**: Classification model design and training
- **XING, Wanli**: Keyboard interface design

## Appendix: Usage Instructions

1. Run `hand_gesture_keyboard.py`
2. Show hand in camera view:
   - Make gestures 0-2 for letter selection
   - Gesture 3 for space
   - Move hand to top to delete
   - Move to screen edges to change pages
3. Confirm with gesture 11 (custom)
